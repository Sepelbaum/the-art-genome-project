While abstraction is evident around the world in art and functional objects, its art-historical significance is as a category for 20th-century Western art that moved away from the faithful representation of nature. The origins of abstraction are commonly located in the works of [J.M.W. Turner](/artist/joseph-mallord-william-turner), [Gustave Courbet](/artist/gustave-courbet), [Édouard Manet](/artist/edouard-manet), the [Impressionists](/gene/impressionism), as well as in the early 1900s, when [Paul Cézanne](/artist/paul-cezanne)'s stylized, flattened forms influenced what would eventually be called the [Cubism](/gene/cubism) of [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picass) and [Georges Braque](artist/georges-braque). Arguably the first abstract art movement, Cubism would prove foundational to countless branches of abstract art, including [Futurism](/gene/futurism) in Italy, the non-objective abstraction of [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky), [Kasimir Malevich](/artist/kasimir-malevich), and [Piet Mondrian](/artist/piet-mondrian), and the [Purism](/gene/purism) of [Le Corbusier](/artist/le-corbusier) and [Amédée Ozenfant](/artist/amedee-ozenfant). Though the intervening decades have seen returns to representation in different movements, virtually all of the dominant art forms of the latter half of the 20th century—including [Abstract Expressionism](/gene/abstract-expressionism), [Neo-Dada](/gene/neo-dada), [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art), [Minimalism](/gene/minimalism), and [Conceptual Art](/gene/conceptual-art)—have embraced the power and aesthetic of formal abstraction in lieu of literal representation.

Starting from this truth it is impossible for anyone to express anything essentially real by imitating its exterior surface."" —[Constantin Brancusi](/artist/constantin-brancusi)_

In the early 20th century, many avant-garde sculptors pushed the bounds of accepted modes of representation, abandoning faithfulness to the visible world in favor of abstraction. The question many artists asked was no longer how to reproduce the world as it appeared, but rather how to best express realities of life (sensed and theorized) through forms. Ever since, abstract sculpture has offered particularly fertile ground for experiments in shape, proportion, and technique, as well as for the embrace of non-traditional sculpting methods (apart from casting, welding, or direct carving), such as industrial manufacturing processes, plastic moulds, and even [3D printing](/gene/3d-printed). Modern strands of abstract sculpture include [Concrete Art](/gene/concrete-art)'s mathematically precise and elegant forms, the strict geometry and forceful presence of [Minimalist](/gene/minimalism) objects, and [Kinetic Sculpture](/gene/kinetic-sculpture)'s embodiment of movement and physical forces."

You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality.” —[Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)_

Of all the art battles and debates of the 20th century, none has been as divisive as that between abstract and figurative art. With the emergence of [Cubism](/gene/cubism) and the movements and artists that followed it, as well as the writings of American critics like Clement Greenberg, the progression towards a non-objective abstraction (wherein no objects could be recognized) became the dominant story of modern art; in turn, figuration became discredited, labeled as retrograde and aligned with enemy politics (read: Communism and [Socialist Realism](/gene/socialist-realism), or the National Socialist dictate of figurative art). Yet in reality, for many artists throughout the 20th century and into the present day, the dividing line between abstraction and figuration was much more porous, leading these artists to create paintings and works on paper somewhere in between the two. In the immediate post-war period in Europe, [Francis Bacon](/artist/francis-bacon) walked what he called the “tightrope between abstraction and figuration” to ask existential questions about the image of man, while contemporary artists like [Cecily Brown](/artist/cecily-brown) continue the tradition of [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), pushing their figures even closer to complete abstraction."

The term and the treatment of objects described as such have a controversial history, as many non-Western art objects have been treated as archeological, rather than art historical, artifacts, appearing in natural history museums to this day. Efforts to include this artwork in international exhibitions began in the 1980s with such exhibitions as 1984’s “Primitivism,” at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in which traditional African objects were placed alongside the 20th-century European works they influenced, including those by [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) and [Max Ernst](/artist/max-ernst). The 1989 exhibition “Magiciens de la Terre,” at Centre Pompidou, Paris, sought to remedy the Eurocentrism surrounding modern art through a balanced presentation of artists spanning all continents but received criticism for its treatment of African and Oceanic artists.

These include precise techniques for carving and casting free-standing sculptures and the undertaking of large-scale urban building projects, which stemmed from access to and the skilled use of materials ranging from marble to bronze to concrete. “Man is the measure of all things” was a central maxim in Greek culture, and as such, Greek artists scrutinized human forms closely to create idealized Classical figures. They also presented detailed depictions of mythological narratives, which often accentuated the human traits of the pantheon of gods. Roman artists borrowed heavily from these narratives, while contributing many of their own. These developments in art were accompanied by new forms of political life, most notably the form of democracy that emerged in Athens and reached its height during the 5th century BC (the Parthenon was built 447-432 BC). Athens and its neighbors in the eastern Mediterranean participated in a seafaring culture that resulted in a great amount of cultural and economic exchange. Under the Roman Empire (27 BC-395 AD), territories stretching from the present-day Middle East to Scotland were brought under centralized rule. Beginning in the 4th century, cultural and political power shifted to the east of the empire, with Constantinople becoming the capital in 330 and much of the western territory falling into the hands of northern European conquerors thereafter. Around this time, Christianity began to supplant pagan religion—at first persecuted by the state but in the 4th century becoming the official religion under Constantine, which led to the growth of a new body of iconography that would flourish in [Byzantine Art](/gene/byzantine-art)."

The term refers to the renewed effort of artists to achieve exact representations of nature and idealized forms of the human body, which radically departed from the appearance of art and architecture of the preceding Middle Ages. While the [Early Renaissance](/gene/early-renaissance) period in Italy drew from Byzantine aesthetics, the [High Renaissance](/gene/high-renaissance) returned to forms from classical antiquity. This shift was due in part to the development of oil paint in Netherlandish regions and the growing trade of information throughout Europe. In addition to new painting techniques, artists turned toward other areas of study, such as the sciences (which, as a result, also experienced a renewed enthusiasm) and scientific ideas regarding perspective.

Though portraits are generally defined as representations of real individuals intended to capture a likeness, as Freud aptly expresses in the quote above, there is more to a portrait than an exact replication of the subject’s facial features. One of the oldest traditions in art, portraiture has served a variety of purposes, from recording appearances and acting as commemorative gifts, to asserting power. Early portraits preserved likenesses of men after their death, as in Egyptian sarcophagi, death masks, and other [funerary objects](gene/funerary-object). In the [Greek](gene/greek-art) and [Roman](gene/roman-art) periods, statues and coins featured faithful depictions of rulers and distinguished individuals—a convention that was revived during the [Renaissance](gene/renaissance) and after by artists like [Hans Holbein the Younger](artist/hans-holbein-the-younger), [Rembrandt van Rijn](artist/rembrandt-van-rijn) and [Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres](artist/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres). These artists emphasized the subject’s pose, dress, and setting to convey a sense of individual identity or even inner psychology. More than any work, [Leonardo da Vinci](artist/leonard-da-vinci)’s Mona Lisa proved that beyond physical likeness, it is often the portraits' intangible essence—possibly the sitter’s thoughts or the stories around the work—that captivates viewers for hundreds of years after their creation."

The French Academy, one of the most influential and elite art institutions in Europe, limited female membership to four artists, a practice whose end was successfully petitioned in 1790 by [Rococo](/gene/rococo) painter Adélaïde Labille-Guiard, contemporary with Marie Antoinette’s preferred portraitist, [Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun](/artist/louise-elisabeth-vigee-le-brun). Swiss-born [Neoclassicist](/gene/neoclassicism) [Angelica Kauffman](/artist/angelica-kauffmann) was a founding member of the British Royal Academy in 1768, although no other women were elected until 1922. Women have continued the struggle for recognition in modern and contemporary art spheres, to such an extent that feminist collective Guerilla Girls asked in 1989, “Do women have to be naked to get into the Met[ropolitan] Museum?”

In the West in the 20th century various reasons accounted for painters’ use of this simplified palette. For example, Kazimir Malevich’s [_Black Square_](/artwork/kasimir-severinovich-malevich-black-square) was one of the first expressions of the artist’s [Suprematist](/gene/suprematism) theories. Additionally, [Robert Rauschenberg](/artist/robert-rauschenberg) made his modular panel “[White Paintings](/artwork/robert-rauschenberg-white-painting-seven-panel)” in 1951 with the aim of creating something that did not look as if it were done by hand. In doing so, he paved the way for later [Minimalist art](/gene/minimalism). In 1961, [John Cage](/artist/john-cage) famously referred to Rauschenberg’s works as “airports for the lights, shadows, and particles,” proposing a reading of them as reflections (and recipients) of the life occurring in front of them."

Greek and Roman marble sculptures, though often thought of as pristine white, were in fact brightly painted. Throughout the history of Islamic art, intricate, ornamental tilework and mosaics often boasted bright color schemes as well. Bright colors—saturated hues with a high level of lightness—evoke strong associations and meanings throughout the world, denote deities, emotions, or ideas. However, with the rise of Neo-Classicism in the West, which embraced the dictates of purity and “good taste,” bright colors were deemed too garish and fell out of fashion. With the advent of abstraction in the 20th century, however, artists once again widely explored bright colors, oftentimes as a means of expressing psychological experiences. Before the advent of synthetic pigments in the early 18th century, bright colors were difficult and costly to achieve, but since the mass-manufacturing of bold pigments and dyes beginning in the mid-20th century, bright colors are widely available.

As this brutal chapter in world history has had long-reaching social consequences, artists who take the African Diaspora as their subject matter may also deal with the development of post-colonial African nations, or, more broadly, the transnational quality of Black culture at large in the modern world. Often informed by Pan-Africanism, or the solidarity of African peoples worldwide, aesthetic approaches to the African Diaspora may critique the economies of the transatlantic slave trade, histories of colonialism and its legacies, as well as celebrate the cultural and artistic accomplishments of people of African descent (directly countering the alignment of African art with Primitivism, a trend amongst European modern artists like [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) and the German Expressionist group [Die Brücke](/gene/die-brucke)).

Artists' interest in the aesthetic and symbolic qualities of decaying and decomposing matter has persisted throughout the history of art.

A frequent target of avant-garde attacks since the late 19th-century, the institutions of art were condemned perhaps most fervently in the _Futurist Manifesto_ (1909), which called upon artists to “set fire to the library shelves! Turn aside the canals to flood the museums!” The term “institutional critique,” however, has come to designate a strand of conceptual art beginning in the 1960s and associated with [Michael Asher](/artist/michael-asher), [Marcel Broodthaers](/artist/marcel-broodthaers), [Daniel Buren](/artist/daniel-buren), and [Hans Haacke](/artist/hans-haacke). These artists sought to expose the ideologies and power structures underlying the circulation, display, and discussion of art. In his seminal 1972 work _the eagle from the Oligocene to the present_, for example, Broodthaers brought together 266 found objects and displayed a wall text alongside each one that read “This is not a work of art,” thus questioning museums’ role in exhibiting and conferring status to artworks, as well as the role of the artist as the maker of original artworks.

In the 1980s, its application to cultural production was advanced in fields of critical race theory and ethnic and feminist studies by scholars Evelyn Nakano Glenn and Patricia Hill Collins. Artists who take intersectionality as their focus are interested in the way that different types of discrimination—such as racism, classism, xenophobia, misogyny, or ageism—can converge and impact individuals and groups, and their work explores these complex interactions. In her photographic portraits of LGBT youth, South African photographer [Zanele Muholi](/artist/zanele-muholi) creates positive images of black queer identity. Exploring the intersection of non-Western subjects and [gender](/gene/gender), [Yasumasa Morimura](/artist/yasumasa-morimura), a Japanese conceptual photographer, inserts himself into re-creations of iconic works from the history of Western art, often impersonating female figures like Johannes Vermeer’s [_Girl with a Pearl Earring_](/artwork/johannes-vermeer-girl-with-a-pearl-earring-1) to comment on Asian masculinity and [globalization](/gene/globalization) in art history. For contemporary portraiture artists like [Kehinde Wiley](/artist/kehinde-wiley) and [Mickalene Thomas](/artist/mickalene-thomas), the socially charged junction of blackness and masculinity or blackness and femininity, respectively, becomes a site of intervention into historical subjects and codes of representation."

As it is typically the fate of an artist to work alone, isolation and alienation are frequent themes throughout the history of art. Whether a painting of a solitary figure or a photograph of a barren landscape, these works carry a pervading sense of emptiness or sadness. Especially in the modern world, figures don't have to be by themselves to feel isolated or alienated. Impressionist painters like [Edgar Degas](/artist/edgar-degas) portrayed figures who were surrounded by people yet entirely bored and alone, a theme picked up some decades later in [Edward Hopper](/artist/edward-hopper)'s _Nighthawks_. [Vincent van Gogh](/artist/vincent-van-gogh) and [Edvard Munch](/artist/edvard-munch), alluded to their own and others’ isolation explicitly in chilling portraits, often produced in series."

After a long period of isolation, Japan resumed trade with the West in 1853, and Japanese goods soon began to pour into Europe. Japanese objects were especially fashionable in Paris and London, and the term Japonisme was coined in 1872 by Parisian critic Phillippe Burty, whose vast collection of Japanese artworks drew the attention of [Edgar Degas](/artist/edgar-degas) and numerous Impressionists. Japanese aesthetics, as exemplified by _Ukiyo-e_ (""Pictures of the Floating World""), inspired asymmetric compositions, flattened modeling, calligraphic brushstrokes, pure bright colors, and the representation of transient, everyday scenes. These tendencies are visible in works of [Mary Cassatt](/artist/mary-cassatt), as well as Nabis painters [Pierre Bonnard](/artist/pierre-bonnard) and [Édouard Vuillard](/artist/edouard-vuillard); [Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec](/artist/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec) was inspired by Kabuki theatre prints, while [Paul Gauguin](/artist/paul-gauguin) adapted Japanese woodcut techniques. In England, [James Abbott McNeill Whister](/artist/james-abbott-mcneill-whistler) was Japonisme's most vigorous proponent. The influence of Japan endured in Western art, appearing later in [Art Nouveau](/gene/art-nouveau), and then again during the move towards abstraction in the 20th century.

In the 20th century, with the rise of industrial manufacturing, the term has become more generally associated with mass commodities or cheap entertainment, considered decorative or evocative of lowbrow taste. Kitsch suffered its most serious intellectual blow in art circles when Clement Greenberg railed against it in a famous 1939 essay, in which he claimed it anathema to progressive, avant-garde art since it pandered to the masses. The rise of consumerism in the United States and Europe in the 1950s and '60s generated an artistic interest in popular culture, however, often with an eye towards dismantling the divide between ostensibly “fine art” and mass appeal; nowhere was this more notable than with the rise of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) in the United States. Today, the idea that something can be “so bad it’s good” is so common that the term “kitsch” no longer retains the negative associations it once did, and artists today often create works that embrace bad taste and question the high- and lowbrow division in art. Importantly, while kitsch is generally associated with European or American culture, it has parallels throughout the world. For example, the concept of kawaii—or cuteness—in Japanese culture is a quality opposed to the aesthetic ideal of refinement and plays a prominent role in popular culture and entertainment.

[_The Rosetta Stone_](/artwork/the-rosetta-stone-1) (196 B.C.), inscribed in three languages, is one of the earliest artifacts that demonstrated the need for translation in order to communicate history. The use of language as a primary material emerged as a central feature of [Conceptual Art](/gene/conceptual-art), as embodied in [Joseph Kosuth](/artist/joseph-kosuth)'s works involving images and corresponding dictionary definitions, or [Lawrence Weiner](/artist/lawrence-weiner)'s treatment of language as sculptural matter.

[Botticelli](/artist/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli) further advanced the idea of divine love, as seen in his [_Birth of Venus_](/artwork/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli-the-birth-of-venus).

In recent years, large numbers of migrant workers from South and Central America and the Caribbean have traveled to the United States, while the Mediterranean Sea has seen thousands of migrants traveling from northern Africa to Europe. Many contemporary artists address the global scope of migration and its personal and political consequences: the French collective Claire Fontaine has installed a neon sign reading “Foreigners Everywhere” in various translations in numerous locations worldwide, drawing attention to the universal concern with immigration. [Alfredo Jaar](/artist/alfredo-jaar)’s One Million Finnish Passports (1995) references the total number of citizenship applications rejected by Finland, bringing attention to the impact of stringent citizenship policies in the EU. Other important examples of migration in art include [Titian](/artist/titian)’s strikingly large-scale 1514 woodblock print, [The Submersion of the Pharaoh’s Army in the Red Sea](/artwork/titian-the-submersion-of-pharaohs-army-in-the-red-sea), which represents a key scene in the escape of the Israelites from Egypt in the Old Testament. [Jacob Lawrence](/artist/jacob-lawrence)’s 60-panel narrative painting series, “The Migration of the Negro” (1940–41), documents the Great Migration, in which 6 million African Americans relocated to Northern cities from the rural South between 1910 and 1970.

In Classical sculpture, scenes of death ranged from highly dramatic mythological scenes to the deeply introspective last moments of mortal subjects. On a more intimate scale, the pietà (Mary mourning of the body of Christ) became a commonly painted and sculpted subject beginning in the 13th century in Northern Europe; it soon spread to the south, and continued to appear regularly into the 17th century. The vanitas image, a reflection on the transitory nature of human existence that includes memento mori like skulls or hourglasses, was popularized in 17th-century Netherlands. From the 18th to the 19th centuries, French painting saw a shift from the admiring scenes of mortal struggle by [Romantics](/gene/romanticism) to sedate scenes by Realists, such as Gustave Courbet’s [_Burial at Ornans_](/artwork/gustave-courbet-the-burial-at-ornans). In 20th century Western art, reflections on mortality range from scenes of brutal atrocity (e.g. [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)’s _Guernica_) to the self-destructing machines of [Jean Tinguely](/artist/jean-tinguely), to homages to the victims of AIDS (by [Nan Goldin](/artist/nan-goldin) and [Felix Gonzalez-Torres](/artist/felix-gonzalez-torres), amongst others).

Modern, largely secular works about mourning often present sites for social memorializing of public figures or groups. These often take the form of figurative sculptures of specific individuals, such as Auguste Rodin’s _[Monument to Balzac](/artwork/auguste-rodin-monument-to-honore-de-balzac)_ (1891–7), though others explore mourning through abstraction, such as [Maya Lin](/artist/maya-lin)’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C., which offers an immersive environment for visitors to pay tribute to the American soldiers who lost their lives in the Vietnam War.

A decade later, the French writer Henri Michaux explored these ideas in asemic writing—writing that resembles natural language but conveys no meaning. Since then, artists have developed personal systems of pictograms and glyphs with varying degrees of legibility and idiosyncrasy, often to explore a wide range of concepts. In the 1960s, for example, [A.R.

As artist Nancy Holt states in one of her video works, ""I am surrounded by me,"" an aesthetic and psychological state Krauss refers to as ""self-encapsulation"". While some artists indulge this state, others criticize it or use it as a window onto social and political issues. [Eleanor Antin](/artist/eleanor-antin)’s autobiographical performances in the early '70s incorporated political critiques from a feminist perspective, while [Cindy Sherman](/artist/cindy-sherman)'s serial portraits of herself enacting female clichés offer a critique of gender roles.

While homosexuality was embraced in Classical Greece, as evident in the era’s philosophy and artwork, throughout most of history it has been rejected and persecuted. Artworks that explore non-heterosexual identities have consequently often done so implicitly, such as [Marsden Hartley](/artist/marsden-hartley)'s _Portrait of a German Officer_, in which the artist depicts his lover using abstract insignia. Later, subtle references to homosexuality appeared in the works of [Jasper Johns](/artist/jasper-johns) and [Robert Rauschenberg](/artist/robert-rauschenberg)—who were lovers and collaborators—and the gay icon [Andy Warhol](/artist/andy-warhol) developed a signature camp aesthetic. With the arrival of the AIDS crisis in the 1970s and ‘80s, numerous members of the art community lost their lives, and homosexuality became an overt, politicized theme; [Nan Goldin](/artist/nan-goldin), [Felix Gonzalez-Torres](/artist/felix-gonzalez-torres), [Keith Haring](/artist/keith-haring), and [David Wojnarowicz](/artist/david-wojnarowicz) found unique means of expressing the tragedies and struggles of this period.

The 19th century saw the Louisiana Purchase (1803) and the First Transcontinental Railroad (1869) greatly extend the reach of American settlement, access to natural resources, and lines of commerce. Far beyond its economic implications, however, the American West was a national mythology—a site of wilderness, exploration, and lawless freedom that for many represented the path to the American dream and a belief in Manifest Destiny. While this collective history brings national pride for many, westward expansion also saw its most brutal forms in the massive displacement and killing of Native Americans. Since the early 19th century artists have documented the exploration of frontier lands, as in [Carleton Emmons Watkins](/artist/carleton-emmons-watkins)’ iconic views of Yosemite National Park or [William Henry Jackson](/artist/william-henry-jackson)’s framing of the transcontinental railroad tunneling through mountains. Others, like [Frederic Remington](/artist/frederic-remington), romanticized its inhabitants through loose renderings of horsemen, cavalrymen, Native Americans, or [cowboys](/tag/cowboy)—from Andy Warhol’s depiction of [John Wayne](/artwork/andy-warhol-john-wayne) to [Richard Prince](/artist/richard-prince)’s appropriation of the iconic cowboy from Marlboro cigarette advertisements."

Modern science has defined the chemical properties of elements as a pure chemical substance consisting of a single type of atom, such as gold, iron, hydrogen, or mercury. Artworks in this category may take a single element or entire systems as their subject matter and may explore various natural or synthetic processes related to them, such as the pseudoscience of alchemy or chemical reactions like oxidation, combustion, or precipitation.

Iconic [Land Art](/gene/land-art) projects by [Robert Smithson](/artist/robert-smithson) and [Christo and Jean-Claude](/artist/christo-and-jeanne-claude) were both celebrated for creating new spaces and audiences for art, and critiqued for the damage they often inflicted on their environments.

In 1982, [Joseph Beuys](/artist/joseph-beuys) also initiated the planting of 7,000 oak trees throughout Kassel, Germany as his contribution to Documenta 7.

The concept of trauma as personal struggle, however, became foundational in Greek mythology, with the trials and tribulations of a hero lying at the heart of Greek tragic drama. Medieval Christian art developed the motif known as the “Man of Sorrows”—a wounded and bloodied Christ figure, bearing a crown of thorns and a sorrowful expression—as an evocative reminder of suffering, meant to invoke devotion on the part of the viewer. In the 20th century, artists have been less concerned with the connection of pain to spiritual redemption, and more with the emotional and psychological toll exacted by violence, injury, suffering, or war. Iconic examples include [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso)’s  _Guernica_ and works by [Otto Dix](/artist/otto-dix). World War II and the Holocaust had a profound impact on art; [Christian Boltanski](/artist/christian-boltanski) and [Anselm Kiefer](/artist/anselm-kiefer), for example, developed different modes of representation to respond to the traumatic nature of those events.

The word “utopia” derives from Thomas Moore's fictional account, in 1516, of an idealized island community of the same name. Artists and architects have since attempted to employ urban planning and the arts to visualize or create livable utopias. [Le Corbusier](/artist/le-corbusier), for example, envisioned a new type of urbanism, one in which living and working took place in separate spheres, and modern highways replaced the dark, crowded slums of the old European city. “Modernity was the time of desire for utopia,” the philosopher Boris Groys has said, and indeed many consider modern architecture and urban planning of the 20th century to have failed the pressing societal issues of the day. Contemporary artists often examine past utopian ideologies critically, such as [David Maljkovic](/artist/david-maljkovic) or [Mark Titchner](/artist/mark-titchner), while others attempt to create ideal communities in the here-and-now through performance or socially engaged work.

Attempts at objective portraiture—the honest, real, unmediated portrayal of a person—have a long history in photography. In a series of sober portraits from the 1920s, German photographer [August Sander](/artist/august-sander) systematically documented his countrymen; the uniform staging and composition of these works accentuated social and professional markings, turning his subjects into social types. This series revealed a tension between a photograph’s ability to reveal something of a sitter’s individuality and inner life, and its exact representation of outward appearance. In recent practice, many photographers have also tried to present their subjects as they really are, flaws and all, while allowing for moments of candidness and vulnerability. Less austere (and more deliberate) than a mug shot, these works often bring facial features into high relief, allowing expressiveness to recede and making the sitter seem somehow up-close and removed at the same time.

Artists in this vein employ outdated, labor-intensive techniques, digitally introduce fading, or manually produce the wear-and-tear of vintage photographs—all by way of eschewing the crystal clarity and crisp lighting of much of today's photography."

Recent scholarship on Minimalism, however, has argued for its embeddedness in the politics of its day: the use of industrial materials, such as steel and Plexiglas, spoke to American military-industrial prowess, while repeated modular elements conjured a consumer society of replication. Such insights trouble the concept of “pure form” that has long been associated with the movement, creating a fruitful legacy for contemporary artists working in this vein."

Caricatures exaggerate features of individuals for the purpose of humor, mockery or criticism. Related to caricature, parody is a narrative or literary device—as opposed to a type of visual depiction—that imitates an original work or set of conventions while distorting it to comic, satirical or critical effect. In Western art, parody can be traced back to ancient Greek drama, while caricature is generally considered to have emerged out of 16th-century carnivalesque culture and grotesque disfigurations of the human figure. Over the course of the late-18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the United States, caricatures circulated in the press and pamphlets often delivered pointed political or social commentary. [William Hogarth](/artist/william-hogarth), considered the father of English caricature, made light of English social mores in his paintings and prints of the late 1700s, and by the 1830s in France a publication devoted entirely to the form, _La Caricature_, provided a forum for [Honoré Daumier](/artist/honore-daumier)’s political drawings. These modes—in particular parody—have been of interest to late-20th-century artists in part because of their prevalence in culture at large, as the popularity of the mockumentary, satirical sketch comedy, lampoons, and spoofs attests."

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, artists such as [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) took up the subject of circus performers, building on a long tradition of their representation in art.

Greek mythology, concerned largely with the lives of gods and heroic humans, has origins in oral tradition but was recorded by poets such as Homer, Sophocles, and Euripides. Roman mythology, which borrowed heavily from Greek predecessors, often dealt with myths of origin, social institutions, and human destiny; key poets included Virgil and Ovid and central stories include those of the She-Wolf of the Capitoline and the Rape of the Sabine Women. Mythological narratives were represented widely in Greek and Roman art, particularly in pottery, sculpture, and mosaics. The allegorical power of the widely known stories remained long after the decline of associated pagan religions, and overlaps between pagan and Christian imagery are visible in the tombs of the earliest Christians. While classical imagery was largely dormant in the Medieval period, it returned in full force in iconic Renaissance paintings and sculptures by the likes of [Botticelli](/artist/alessandro-filipepi-called-sandro-botticelli), [Titian](/artist/tiziano-vecellio-called-titian), and [Raphael](/artist/raphael-raffaello-sanzio-da-urbino) in Italy and [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) in Germany, all of whom sought to reconcile Christian piety with Classical thought. Subsequent painters who dealt regularly with classical themes included [Peter Paul Rubens](/artist/peter-paul-rubens) and [Nicolas Poussin](/artist/nicolas-poussin), and in 17th- and 18th-century academic painting, the use of classical stories was an esteemed technique.

Food has long been a favored subject of artists, and at times even a medium for making art. In Western Art, depictions of food date back to funerary paintings of food offerings in ancient Egypt. The Classical historian Pliny claimed that Greek painter Zeuxis once painted grapes so realistic that birds came to pick at them. Depictions continued in [Roman art](/gene/roman-art), where the putto (male infant) depicted with grape vines was a common motif.

While nature themes—plants, animals, or spirits—have been central to art since pre-history, the landscape genre, which favors sweeping topographical surveys over mere individual natural elements, emerged in ancient Greece in scenic theater backdrops and domestic frescoes. After the fall of the Roman Empire, landscape motifs were largely absent from European art until the 14th century, but they flourished in Asia, particularly in the mist-shrouded mountains and visions of untamed nature of Song Dynasty (10th-13th century China) ink paintings. In European art since the [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance), artists and theorists have debated whether landscapes should depict “real” or “ideal” views of the natural world. An example of the latter is [Annibale Carracci](/artist/annibale-carracci)’s _Flight into Egypt_ (1604), in which tranquil skies and neatly tailored hills make for an impossible idyll, as if ordered by divine law.

Leisure was a central focus of 18th-century [Rococo](/gene/rococo) painters such as [Jean-Honoré Fragonard](/artist/jean-honore-fragonard); the 19th century saw leisure presented in countless different ways, from Édouard Manet’s suggestive [_Luncheon on the Grass_](/artwork/edouard-manet-luncheon-on-the-grass-le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe) to Georges Seurat’s masterwork [A Sunday on La Grande Jatte](/artwork/georges-seurat-a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte).

The accurate rendering of light and shadow is one of the most important techniques in the history of Western painting, as well as a continually essential tenet of photography. Fittingly, light itself—its manipulation, its expert rendering, its natural beauty—is often the dominant focus of works of art. Light is a consistent concern in works that foreground [chiaroscuro](/gene/chiaroscuro) techniques, such as those by [Titian](/artist/titian) or [Caravaggio](/artist/michelangelo-merisi-da-caravaggio). [Impressionism](/gene/impressionism) made light a central focus, in particular capturing its changing effects on a landscape. After the invention of photography (sometimes called “light-drawing”), artists still worked towards perfecting the various ways in which the play of light and shadow fall across a face, the city, or the landscape. In the 1960s and '70s, the [Light and Space Movement](/gene/light-and-space-movement) investigated light’s effect on the viewer and the environment; works by [Robert Irwin](/artist/robert-irwin) and [James Turrell](/artist/james-turrell), for example, used light beams and lightboxes as a material in geometric, minimalist installations, extracting everything else from the environment to isolate one's perception of space and light."

To trace the history of nature in art is, essentially, to trace the history of art itself. The ancient Greeks established the imitation of nature as the highest aim of art, and Chinese artists dating from the earliest dynasties have turned to the mountainous landscape as the physical manifestation of _Qi_, the vital energy of the universe. Many major movements of the intervening centuries have been defined by their increasingly subjective treatment of nature. The sweeping [Romantic](/gene/romanticism) landscapes of [J.M.W. Turner](/artist/joseph-mallord-william-turner) and [Caspar David Friedrich](/artist/caspar-david-friedrich) emphasized the subjugation of man to the sublime environment, while [Impressionists](/gene/impressionism) like [Claude Monet](/artist/claude-monet) immersed themselves [_en plein air_](/gene/en-plein-air), attempting to capture the overall visual experience of the landscape rather than depict it literally. Even much of modern abstraction has centered on nature—[Abstract Expressionists](/gene/abstract-expressionism) like [Helen Frankenthaler](/artist/helen-frankenthaler) and [Op artists](/gene/op-art) like [Bridget Riley](/artist/bridget-riley) saw their practices as channeling the primal forces, energies, and rhythms of the natural world. “I don’t paint nature,” [Jackson Pollock](/artist/jackson-pollock) once said. “I am nature.”"

The detailed renderings of triumphant vessels, dramatic scenes of storms, shipwrecks and maritime warfare (seen in [Ludolf Backhuysen](/artist/ludolf-backhuysen)’s _Ships in Distress off a Rocky Coast_) [1667]), characteristic of Dutch Golden Age painting, made this a notable genre of the age, in which it was employed to reflect the dangers and prominence of 17th-century Dutch naval ingenuity. [Romanticism](/gene/romanticism) and 19th-century American landscape painting broadened the genre to include more stylized and metaphorical depictions of man’s encounter with the natural world. Romantic artists [Albert Pinkham Ryder](/artist/albert-pinkham-ryder) and [J.M.W. Turner](/artist/joseph-mallord-william-turner) often evoked the darker symbolism of the ship at sea in their work—as the triumph of personal freedom over man-made boundaries, the possibilities of passing into the unknown, or as an allegory for the voyage of life. Nineteenth-century American painter [Winslow Homer](/artist/winslow-homer) represented the pleasure and peril of the nautical in two iconic works: _Breezing Up a Fair Wind_ (1873–76), in which Winslow captures the leisurely pleasure of a summer sailing day, and _The Life Line_ (1884), which highlights the dangers of the open sea in its dramatic depiction of a near drowning."

Such ideas were applied to art beginning in the 15th century. For example, [Leon Battista Alberti](/artist/leon-battista-alberti)'s architectural designs made explicit reference to musical harmony and employed ratios that he thought would produce consonances. This type of practice became widespread in Renaissance architecture and soon found a place in investigations of linear perspective in drawing and painting, such as in the work of [Leonardo da Vinci](/artist/leonardo-da-vinci). Music was essential to early forays into abstraction at the beginning of the 20th century, as it served as an ideal starting point for emotive, non-representational compositions such as those of [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky), [Paul Klee](/artist/paul-klee), and [Francis Picabia](/artist/francis-picabia), all of whom were part of artistic and intellectual communities that included musicians.

Fame can transform ordinary subjects into icons or superficial facades: from Mao Zedong to Lassie, this transformation is a product of cultural fascination. In the 20th century, the elevation of celebrities and the rapid circulation of their images - a.k.a. the ""cult of celebrity"" - inspired a consideration of the powers of popular culture and a curiosity to know these figures. For example, Andy Warhol's silkscreen process enabled a speed of image production that rivaled that of the tabloids but elevated celebrities to the status of painterly subjects. While some artists honored the glamour and heroism associated with celebrity, others exposed its darker side: a loss of individuality and a dehumanizing objectification by the media."

Figure studies—preparatory drawings typically rendered in chalk, charcoal, crayon, or ink—have played an integral role in the history of Western Art.

During the Renaissance, figure studies also proved essential to fresco painters—who aimed to depict accurate figures in the fast-drying medium—as well as for artists needing to show plans to patrons for commissions. The preparation of studies was later central to the practices of French academic painters and [Neoclassicists](/gene/neoclassicism). While in subsequent years, with the more expressive tendencies of [Romanticism](/gene/romanticism) and [Impressionism](/gene/impressionism), preparatory stages were omitted in favor of direct application of paint on the canvas, the medium endured.

Gesture, grimace, clothing, decor even—all must combine to realize a character.” —Charles Baudelaire_

Individual portraiture—the likeness of a single person—has long been one of the most popular forms of art. Whether as an attempt at objective or documentary truth or to express the power and prestige (or idea) of a person, individual portraits examine what it means to be human and an individual. Classical Greek portraiture was concerned with formal, ideal beauty rather than documentary truth. The Renaissance and a renewed interest in humanism established the great portrait tradition, which would pervade Europe for the next three hundred years, dominated by [Raphael](/artist/raphael) in Rome and [Titian](/artist/titian) in Venice. Individual portraits were also often commissioned by monarchs to reinforce and display royal might: [Hans Holbein](/artist/hans-holbein-the-younger)’s famous portrait of Henry VIII is a quintessential example of the portrait’s power to flatter and play to a sitter’s vanity. Likewise, portraits played a vital role in displaying and mirroring the material wealth of the growing merchant class in the Dutch golden age, as in the work of [Frans Hals](/artist/frans-hals) or [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn). The invention of photography in the mid 1800s caused the portrait tradition to rapidly change; the newfound ability to capture an individual “as they were” meant that the painted portrait could no longer be taken for granted. Many variations in the photographic portrait resulted as did the exploration of how abstract painting might still make a portrait. Artists continue today to reconcile the traditional means of portraiture with photography."

Since concrete can be poured and metal can be bent into any shape, many architects have taken advantage of this versatile and cost-effective material to construct complex structures. Beginning in the early 20th century, the Belgian architect Auguste Perret (with the help of his brothers, Gustave and Claude) built the world’s first reinforced concrete apartment block at 25 rue Franklin, in Paris. The unparalleled strength of reinforced concrete meant that fewer structural supports were needed, which allowed Perret to use large windows on the facade to let in more light and to create more open space on each floor. Many iconic buildings of the 20th and 21st centuries have since been built using reinforced concrete construction, including [Frank Lloyd Wright](/artist/frank-lloyd/wright)’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, in New York; [Le Corbusier](/artist/le-corbusier)’s Villa Savoye, in Paris; and the Burj Khalifa (currently the world’s tallest building), in Dubai.

Developments in lighting saw rapid changes during the Industrial Revolution. Gas street lamps arrived in London in 1815; the electric arc lamp, made from two carbon electrodes, was developed in the early 19th century and first used at the Paris Opéra in 1844; and the Englishman Joseph Swan and American Thomas Edison developed the first incandescent electric lamps in 1878 and 1879, hugely increasing access to electrical lighting. Iconic lamp designs, such as those by [Tiffany Studios](/artist/tiffany-studios) and [Isamu Noguchi](/artist/isamu-noguchi), have become iconic, historical works. In the mid-20th century, fluorescent lighting was widely installed in offices and schools.

Though incredibly diverse across regions and time periods, there are two generally recognized types of Aboriginal art: figurative and geometric (though these two styles can often be combined). These works in certain contexts carry understood meanings—geometric designs, for example, are variously believed to have been imparted by ancestors. The artist plays a significant role in traditional Aboriginal society, as artworks are seen as sacred forms of religious knowledge. What is widely understood as Contemporary Aboriginal Art has its roots in an art teacher named Geoffrey Bardon, who in 1971 gave art materials to a group of Aboriginal men in Papunya; when it sparked their interest, he worked with 11 men to form a cooperative, the Papunya Tula Artists, which has since grown to include 60 artists nationwide. Known for its complex abstractions of dots and lines in earth tones, Contemporary Aboriginal is arguably the most significant strand of Australian art today."

In cities such as Tikal, Chichén Itzá, and Tulum (each of which was prominent at a different time), the Mayan people developed architectural forms, such as the pyramid temple and the palace, that employed [masonry construction](/gene/masonry-construction) and were at times adorned with [mosaics](/gene/mosaics). Other developments in Mayan culture included a shared calendar system, the mythological narratives and iconography of the Popol Vuh text, and various instruments used for personal and communal religious functions. The last major Mayan confederacy collapsed as a result of infighting around 1450. Because centralization in Mayan territories was absent, the Spanish conquest of the Yucatán Peninsula was met with over two decades of local resistance before colonial control was solidified in 1546. Nevertheless, pockets of Guatemala remained under Mayan control throughout the 17th century, and Mayan language and customs persist in the region today."

After centuries of being relegated to ethnological displays and curio cabinets, traditional African art entered into the European consciousness (and museums) as “art” at the turn of the 20th century, in part through its association with the European avant-garde. European modernists admired the aesthetics of what they called “Primitive Art,” a designation that conflated African art with traditional Oceanic and pre-Columbian art, reflecting the racial and cultural bias against non-White, non-Western cultures at the time. In the 1960s and 1970s, when the study of African art in Europe and America took a scientific and anthropological turn, the term “Tribal Art” was considered preferable to the derogatory connotations of “primitive.” While “Tribal Art” is still used by some experts and collectors today, others reject it for failing to treat African art distinctly.

Having bridged the art-craft divide, present-day ceramic artists like [Katsuyo Aoki](/artist/katsuyo-aoki), [Shio Kusaka](/artist/shio-kusaka), and [Rachel Kneebone](/artist/rachel-kneebone) are evolving the traditional techniques of ceramics practiced by pioneers like Paul Daschel, Edmond Lacenal, and [Galileo Chini](/artist/galileo-chini) to produce increasingly innovative and experimental contemporary ceramic works.

In the 1st century CE a new type of architecture took advantage of refinements in the use of the material, as in [the Pantheon](/artwork/apollodorus-of-damascus-the-pantheon) in Rome, constructed of a large dome atop a massive concrete cylinder. Strong, cheaper than traditional stone, and easily transportable, concrete is made by combining water with an aggregate (such as small pieces of stones or brick) and a binder (such as lime or cement) and then allowing the malleable mass to harden; it is often reinforced with steel bars (rebar) to increase its tensile strength. Underutilized for centuries after the classical period, it became a mainstay of modern architecture and infrastructure. It has been used to construct both masterpieces of aesthetic innovation, such as Le Corbusier’s [_Notre Dame du Haut_](/artwork/le-corbusier-chapelle-de-notre-dame-du-haut-ronchamp-france), and the massive housing blocks and anonymous, utilitarian structures that fueled 20th-century urbanization.

It is not clear exactly when encaustic (from the Greek enkaustikos, “to burn in”) was first used, but some of the earliest surviving examples date from as far back as the 1st century BC. Originally referring to a specific process of using heat to fuse beeswax with pigment and resin, encaustic has become a more general term for the use of wax and painting in tandem. Because of its durability, encaustic was most likely first used by the Greeks in order to waterproof and decorate ships, but eventually found its way into more traditional forms of art. After the fall of the Byzantine empire, where the medium appears in many religious icons, encaustic largely disappeared until the 18th century when it was used by artists trying to imitate Greek and Roman Art. In the 20th century, encaustic is most often associated with the work of [Jasper Johns](/artist/jasper-johns), who used it in his Flag paintings, the first of which was displayed in 1955. Because of its versatility, other artists, such as [Martin Kline](/artist/martin-kline), [Brice Marden](/artist/brice-marden), and [Lynda Benglis](/artist/lynda-benglis), continued to work with encaustic throughout the 20th century and into the present day."

This content usually fills the entirety of the composition, leaving very little negative or blank space. Dense compositions have long played a role in art history: ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic compositions and Greek and Roman sculptural friezes, for instance, almost always included tightly-packed or overlapping human figures. In the 15th and 16th centuries, [Hieronymus Bosch](/artist/hieronymus-bosch) and [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer)'s dense compositions included complex narratives and allegorical messages as well as distinct and original figurative styles. [Mannerism](/gene/mannerism), a style practiced most famously by [El Greco](/artist/el-greco-domenikos-theotokopoulos), responded to the order and idealization of [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance) art with dramatically lit and arranged compositions that left few open spaces. 18th-century [Rococo](/gene/rococo) works were also densely-packed compositions and designs, characterized by profuse ornamentation and fanciful scenes. During the 20th century's shift to abstraction, [Cubist](/gene/cubism) canvases presented a new vision of reality through tightly-arranged, shifting planes of imagery. This preference for densely packed abstract forms and gestures continued with the action paintings [Jackson Pollock](/artist/jackson-pollock), and more recently [Cecily Brown](/artist/cecily-brown)'s chaotic, fragmented depictions of human bodies."

In the 1920s, photographers flaunted the many techniques that lent the camera its unique capacity to capture the modern world. One such technique was particularly striking, turning the world on its head, sometimes literally: the extreme angle. Taken upside-down, from the ground up (what Rodchenko, himself a pioneer of experimental photography, called a ""worm's eye view""), from the sky (aerial views or ""bird's eye views""), tilted (sometimes called the ""Batman angle""), or rotated, photographs can enable us to see the world anew. Such techniques have also been employed—both before and after the advent of photography—by painters, in particular contemporary artists who use photographic source material to show aspects of everyday life from unexpected viewpoints. [Jenny Saville](/artist/jenny-saville), for example, depicts the female figure up-close and from beneath, disorienting the viewer, while [Marilyn Minter](/artist/marilyn-minter) zooms in on individual body parts and accessories from a tilted angle, producing glamorous, off-kilter images with photorealistic precision."

Particularly since the 19th century, western artists have rejected [hyperrealism](/gene/hyperrealism) and the [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance) ideal of linear perspective in order to emphasize the illusionistic nature of painting (the flatness of the picture plane), or engage with more conceptual, pre-Modern, or non-western modes of expressing human form. Artists like [Edouard Manet](/artist/edouard-manet) and [Mary Cassatt](/artist/mary-cassatt), for example, drew inspiration from Japanese _ukiyo-e_ woodblock prints, often rendering broad fields of uniform color that made figures appear compressed against their backgrounds. Clement Greenberg famously identified flatness as the defining characteristic of modern art; the progress towards non-objective abstraction—from [Courbet](/artist/gustave-courbet) through [Mondrian](/artist/piet-mondrian)—was, for Greenberg, the predominant story of modernism. [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) heightened the emphasis on flatness in the 1960s, a tendency that continues today in much contemporary art.

One strong parallel in Western art is the use of “cavalier perspective” in [Renaissance](/gene/renaissance) painting, a method of using a vanishing point to show sweeping views from above, as in [Giorgione](/artist/giorgione)’s _Adoration of the Shepherds_. Modern photographers such as [Andre Kertesz](/artist/andre-kertesz) and [Bill Brandt](/artist/bill-brandt) took pictures at extreme angles to capture long distance, such as in Kertesz’s _Clock of the Academie Francaise_.

The most common types of symmetry in art are bilateral and rotational, and the expression of human interest in symmetry is considered highly anthropomorphic as the typical human body is more-or-less bilaterally symmetrical.

The extent to which each of these forms is related, as well as the history of the term “arabesque,” is hotly debated among art historians. Arabesque has a specific meaning in [Islamic art](/gene/islamic-art-and-architecture), where it refers to the vegetal patterned surface decorations that flourished from the 10th to 15th centuries and adorned walls from Spain to Northern Africa, highly ornamented [calligraphy](/gene/arabic-slash-farsi-calligraphy), or intricate patterning on sculpture and other objects. Its meaning in other aesthetic traditions is less clear (some art historians argue that it should only be used to describe Islamic art).

Since the 1950s, many artists working with canvas have used the medium to probe the fundaments not of paint on a support, but of the support itself. Some have explored the material properties of the support by perforating and slashing it (as did Fontana), twisting and contorting it (like Stephen Parreno), or replacing it entirely with everything from metallic foil to plastic. For Fontana, the alteration of a canvas in his ""Concetto Spaziale"" (spatial concept) series was a way to move beyond the picture plane and activate the space behind and around the work. German artist [Blinky Palermo](/artist/blinky-palermo)’s “Cloth Paintings” (produced between 1966-72) were made by sewing two different colors of cloth together and stretching them over a canvas, which for Palermo expressed the “spiritual presence of color.”"

Though it has come to refer generally to painting that emulates the look of photographs, typically with hyperrealistic clarity, the term ""photorealistic"" traces its roots to Photorealism, the American art movement of the 1960s and ’70s.

However, in Europe, artists like [Gerhard Richter](/artist/gerhard-richter) and [Franz Gertsch](artist/franz-gertsch) have likewise been referred to as photorealists, but for a different reason: the hazy quality and unexpected angles in their candid portraits resemble casual, often blurred snapshots. Today, artists who emulate the look of photographs make work in both ways (and in between), and as a result, push the boundaries of what constitutes a photorealistic image.

Picasso later drew on these principles while employing bright colors and curvilinear forms, flattening his figures to create striking portraits with seemingly distorted facial features.

However, this is a relatively recent development; although early experiments with various photosensitive chemicals began in the 1840s shortly after photography’s birth, it was not until the 1890s that such chemical processes were successfully applied to the production of color film, and only a few early experimenters—mostly amateur scientists or intrepid travelers—used the medium to capture nature, cultural sites, or the occasional sitter. And it wasn't until Kodak’s breakthroughs in the mass manufacture of color film in 1935 that color photography became widely accessible, and commercial photographers swiftly adopted the new “Kodachrome” brand. In art, the delay took even longer; the watershed moment was [William Eggleston](/artist/william-eggleston)’s exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art in 1976—the first major museum exhibition of color photography. The invention of digital photography and advances in printing technologies have further expanded its scope—from digital manipulation to the monumental printing techniques often associated with the [Dusseldorf School of Photography](/gene/dusseldorf-school-of-photography)—and contemporary artists continue to explore new paths for color photography, such as through the use of [photograms](/gene/photogram), diaristic works, or even approaching the photographic print as a sculptural material.

Photography seeking to chronicle actual events, places, and experiences in a truthful and objective manner. Historically, until the broad use of color photography, documentary photography was black and white and captured events with precise focus, limited distortions, and minimal darkroom editing, with the understanding that to manipulate was to distort the truth. It also has characteristically carried a social imperative: to expose what life is like truthfully—in cities, in poverty, in disasters—and to encourage societal progress. Accordingly, some of the best-known historical documentary photographers were also heavily involved in activist causes against poverty and child labor, such as [Jacob Riis](/artist/jacob-august-riis) and [Lewis Hine](/artist/lewis-wickes-hine).

[Robert Morris](/artist/robert-morris) created [felt sculptures](/artwork/robert-morris-untitled-brown-felt) that, when fixed to the wall, sagged under their own weight over time, while [Sam Gilliam](/artist/sam-gilliam) created stained paintings that he then twisted and folded to mirror the dynamism of their colors. Slumped or draped forms may evoke a mood of heaviness or fatigue or may be employed to emphasize the volumetric effects of material under the force of gravity."

Though they produce visually similar results, etching involves incising a wax-coated metal plate with a sharp tool and placing the plate into an acid bath. The acid corrodes the exposed lines, leaving the waxy ground unaffected; the plate is then inked and printed, forcing the paper into the incised lines. Considered one of the great masters of the technique, [Rembrandt van Rijn](/artist/rembrandt-van-rijn) harnessed the medium’s similarity to drawing with a pencil or pen. Engraving, the oldest intaglio technique and the most common method seen in Old Master prints, involves directly incising a metal matrix and then printing.

The technique involves drawing directly on flat stone with an oil-based implement, then coating the stone with a water-based liquid. The applied marks repel the liquid, so that when oil-based ink is applied to the stone it fills in the image, allowing it to be transferred onto a sheet. Since the 19th century, lithography has been widely used by commercial and fine artists as a means to mass-produce images, maps, and texts. It was explored early on by Eugène Delacroix and Honoré Daumier, but it was artists in the latter half of the 19th century who unleashed the medium with bold experimentation. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Édouard Manet took to the stone with a marked freedom, depicting motion and fleeting effects of light, while Pierre Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard infused the rich, natural colors of Impressionist pastels and oil paintings into their lithograph prints. Creative collaborations between artists and master printers have yielded innovative work by artists like Pablo Picasso, Jasper Johns, Robert Motherwell, and Vija Celmins."

Originally used for commercial purposes in the early 20th century, the technique would be termed “serigraphy” in the 1940s to differentiate its use for fine art. Artists of the 1960s, notably Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, incorporated screenprinted images from mass media into their works, while in Europe, artists like Alain Jacquet and Gerd Winner took advantage of the unique ability of the medium to produce large-scale prints."

Woodcut is the oldest printmaking technique, originating in China and reaching the West in the 13th century; the linocut was invented in the late 19th century. The bold mark of a woodcut and the (often apparent) wood grain impression contrasts the more fluid mark of the linocut. During the 15th century, German artist [Albrecht Dürer](artist/albrecht-durer) mastered the technique of carving into wood, finessing the vigorous woodcut mark into articulated fine lines; centuries later, [Expressionists](gene/austrian-and-german-expressionism) like [Ernst Ludwig Kirchner](artist/ernst-ludwig-kirchner) and [Emil Nolde](artist/emil-nolde) would revive the German woodcut tradition, exploring the medium’s graphic potential with more aggressive marks and flat planes of color.

Michelangelo once characterized carving as the process of revealing the shape inherent within a solid mass, penetrating the material to find the image within. Examples of carving can be found in ancient objects the world over, from paleolithic objects decorated with animal forms found in France to Shang dynasty oracle bones incised with ancient writing from China, and classical Greek Caryatid figures still standing today on the Acropolis. Even thousands of years ago, artists like the anonymous sculptor of a voluptuous 10th-century Yogini from India experimented with the ability of carved imagery to operate in both two and three dimensions, creating dramatic volume in contrast to flat space. To this day, carving continues to take forms both minute and monumental, from virtuosic carved sculptures to paintings incised for texture."

By translating designs made on a computer into physical form (a process called computer-aided design, or [CAD](/gene/cad-computer-aided-design), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) can create objects with complex geometries relatively quickly and with a high degree of precision. First developed in the 1960s for the automotive and aerospace industries, CAM has become more consumer friendly in recent years. This is partly due to the diminishing cost barriers of 3-D printing, a process in which typically plastic- or metal-based materials are deposited layer by layer. Other CAM processes include subtractive techniques, in which material is removed from a large starting block (usually of wood or metal) until the digitally designed form is achieved. The two most common types of this technique are CNC routing and milling. Both use a movable rotating cutter guided by digital instructions that cut into and carve a starting block of material. While CAM was originally developed for industrial purposes, artists, architects, and designers have adopted it for its relative speed and cost effectiveness compared to traditional manufacturing techniques."

Variations on this practice have existed around the world, with early instances including ancient Egyptian papyrus painting, ancient Chinese silk painting, and medieval manuscripts. Greater standardization in watercolor production was furthered by the wide distribution of a list of usable pigments in 17th-century England and the invention of portable watercolor boxes in the early 18th century. Old Masters like [Albrecht Dürer](/artist/albrecht-durer) and [Sir Anthony Van Dyck](/artist/sir-anthony-van-dyck) used the medium primarily for landscapes, though often as a delicate accent in ink and chalk drawings. Watercolor gained its strongest standing in the United Kingdom, with watercolorists gaining admission to the Royal Academy by the end of the 18th century and [J. M. W.

This was facilitated by British and Dutch trading companies in South Asia, the trade routes of the Ottoman Empire, and the Spanish administration of South America, amongst many other channels. China, Japan and Korea each experienced dramatic economic expansion and artistic flourishing, but while Chinese goods travelled widely through the global market, Japan maintained a closed economy. The great variety of artistic production in Europe in the 17th century is often loosely grouped under the term “[Baroque](/gene/baroque)”, which in general terms is characterized by a heightened sense of movement and lighting in compositions. In painting, these elements were perhaps first mastered by Caravaggio, who heavily influenced artists across Europe; amongst these were [Diego Velázquez](/artist/diego-velazquez) in Spain and and [Rembrandt](/artist/rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-1) in Holland. The exuberance of Baroque aesthetics combined with the fervor of the Catholic Counter-Reformation is evident in the re-constructed St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, a project which was seen to completion by [Gian Lorenzo Bernini](/artist/gian-lorenzo-bernini). The taste for Baroque art travelled to the Americas, as evidenced by ornate religious buildings most notably in Mexico and Peru. In France, the century witnessed the consolidation of power under absolute monarchy, whose decadence was made visible in the construction of Louis XIV's royal palace at Versailles; the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture was also established under his rule. In the Dutch Republic, whose independence was gained from Spain after 80 years of conflict, an affluent mercantile class created the conditions for a dynamic art market with a preference for portraits, still lifes, cityscapes, and scenes of everyday life.

Perhaps most tellingly, this 20-year period is bookended by a “day which would live in infamy”—the United States’ entry into World War II in 1941—and the Explorer 6 satellite’s transmission of the first picture of Earth from orbit in 1959. The global conflict of WWII was marked by unprecedented crimes against humanity and left behind unprecedented destruction when it ended in 1945. In the fall-out, the world was divided into adversarial spheres of influence (the Cold War), while towards the end of the 1950s former European colonies fought for independence.

The rise of Abstract Expressionism has been attributed to the influence of European movements like [Cubism](/gene/cubism) and [Surrealism](/gene/surrealism), which reached New York in the 1930s and ’40s via museum exhibitions, academic institutions, and the stateside relocation of many major European artists due to World War II."
526700b98b3b81ab780002eb,action-painting,http://artsy.net/gene/action-painting,Action Painting,Style or Movement,"A term coined by the American critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952 to define a specific set of Abstract Expressionist artists who saw the canvas as an “arena in which to act.” Artists like [Jackson Pollock](/artist/jackson-pollock), [Willem de Kooning](/artist/willem-de-kooning), and [Franz Kline](/artist/franz-kline) were associated with this term due to their more spontaneous and/or physical act of painting. Such an idea of painting—emphasizing its physical process—would be highly influential on later artists; Pollock, for example, was a major impetus behind the appearance of [Happenings](/gene/happenings) in the United States in the 1960s. Various critics have tied the appearance of action painting to the ideas of Jung and Freud as well as [Surrealism](/gene/surrealism). Action was a way to evoke the primeval and an archetypal expression, and automatic painting and drawing techniques had previously been practiced by [Joan Miró](/artist/joan-miro) and [André Masson](/artist/andre-masson).

Equally indebted to mythologies of the [African Diaspora](/gene/african-diaspora), Afrofuturism is not an artistic style but an approach to the intersections of race and technology that aims to visualize the future. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, musicians (Sun Ra, Grace Jones, and Parliament Funkadelic), authors (Octavia Butler), and visual artists ([Renee Cox](/artist/renee-cox)) drew upon the futuristic energy of science fiction, seeing outer space as an escape from the oppressive social and political climate of the Vietnam war and post–Civil Rights era. Afrofuturism’s engagement with the African Diaspora is wide-ranging: photojournalist Cristina de Middel took the failed 1964 Zambian space program as the subject of her 2012 series [_Afronaut_](/artwork/cristina-de-middel-bambuit-from-the-series-the-afronauts). Other artists have employed cyborgs, robots, and aliens as alter-egos to access alternative identities, such as Kenyan-American artist [Wangechi Mutu](/artist/wangechi-mutu); others have addressed the habitable space of the cosmos, as in [Kerry James Marshall](/artist/kerry-james-marshall)’s _Keeping the Culture_ or [Sanford Biggers](/artist/sanford-biggers)’s psychedelic quilts referencing cosmological maps."

Named after the medieval Bauhütten, or masons’ lodges, and inspired by the ideas of John Ruskin and William Morris, the Bauhaus is best known for reintroducing workshop training in lieu of traditional studio art education; unifying artistic creativity and manufacturing; emphasizing functionalism in architecture; and revolutionizing streamlined industrial design. After the closure of the Bauhaus, many former students and teachers fled the Nazi dictatorship, spreading the tenets of the school to many parts of the world. [Josef Albers](/artist/josef-albers), for example, helped to mold the fledgling graphic design program at Yale while [Laszlo-Moholy Nagy](/artist/laszlo-moholy-nagy) founded the Institute of Design at IIT in Chicago, often dubbed the “New Bauhaus,” where a generation of prominent American photographers—from [Aaron Siskind](/artist/aaron-siskind) to [Harry Callahan](/artist/harry-callahan)—imparted new vigor to experiments in modernist photography.

The four artists initially associated with the term were [David Park](/artist/david-park), [Elmer Bischoff](/artist/elmer-bischoff), [Richard Diebenkorn](/artist/richard-diebenkorn), and James Weeks, who shifted away from the influences of the area’s prominent abstract painters (like Clyfford Still) around 1950. Later on, painters like [Nathan Oliveira](/artist/nathan-oliveira) and [Joan Brown](/artist/joan-brown), and a single sculptor, [Manuel Neri](/artist/manuel-neri), joined the movement. These artists rendered genre scenes, local landscapes, and figure paintings with a luminous palette. In the 1960s, their works became increasingly idiosyncratic, to the extent that they bled into the [Funk Art](/gene/funk-art) movement of the San Francisco underground. Aided by Diebenkorn’s return to abstraction in the late 1960s, the movement fell into decline, though artists like [Elmer Bischoff](/artist/elmer-bischoff), maintained their styles into the 1970s.

Advanced in 1968 as envisioning an art that “speaks directly to the needs and aspirations of Black America” by poet Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) and writer Larry Neal, the Black Arts Movement urged the reinforcement of such mantras as “Black is beautiful” and James Brown’s “Say It Loud, I’m Black and I’m Proud” in the form of a recognizable iconography. For example, Jae Jarrell created [_Urban Wall Suit_](/artwork/jae-jarrell-urban-wall-suit) (1969), a multicolored suit crafted to appear as a graffiti-covered brick wall and a walking sign of the public voice. Iconic images of activists such as [Bob Marley](/tag/bob-marley), Angela Davis, and [Malcolm X](/tag/malcolm-x) pervaded art and popular culture at this time, as did other symbols like the raised fist, Afro hairstyle, and vivid graphic patterns inspired by art and textiles of the [African Diaspora](/gene/african-diaspora).

Additionally, many Brutalist structures' functional components (such as water tanks, electrical towers, and support pillars) are left exposed on the outside of the building. As an architectural philosophy, Brutalism was often associated with utopian socialist ideology. Completed in 1952, Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse—a public housing complex in Marseille that was built under the premise that each resident should have the same amount of space and equal access to sunlight—is often cited as the initial inspiration for the Brutalist style. Criticism of the style centers around its cold appearance. Brutalist buildings are often also associated with urban decay since they were often built by governments with little money, subject to poor maintenance, and the raw concrete weathered poorly and was subject to vandalism.

Capitalist Realism was launched in 1963 in Germany by the artists [Gerhard Richter](/artist/gerhard-richter), [Sigmar Polke](/artist/sigmar-polke), and Konrad Lueg (later to become the dealer Konrad Fischer) not as a movement, but rather as a send-up. Its most iconic expression was a performance titled “Living with Pop – A Demonstration for Capitalist Realism,” orchestrated by Richter and Lueg in the Berges department store in Dusseldorf that same year. The artists invited patrons to come view “what is hailed in America as the greatest breakthrough in art since Cubism,” as an advertisement for the event proclaimed. Puzzled visitors arrived to find the artists making themselves at home in a staged and decidedly average living room (Richter was reading a mystery novel). Of course Capitalist Realism had no such reputation in the U.S.; the artists were parodying the overnight ascendance of [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art), with its celebrity culture and embrace of everyday commodities, as well as the German craze for all things American.

Later to be called ""cold abstraction,"" this style was often criticized for its transcendental bent and failure to confront the world. [Lucio Fontana](/artist/lucio-fontana), for example, though associated briefly with the Italian Movimento Arte Concreta (M.A.C.), ultimately found his practice to be at odds with the ""sterile and empty"" formalism of this tendency. A central concept in much of Concrete Art was the idea of “real space,” which was further explored in its Latin American iterations like Arte Concreto-Invención, Arte Madí and the Grupo Neoconcreto. After flourishing for some 20 years, by the 1950s the cerebral concerns of this art—its exploration of pure form and universal principles—were being eclipsed by the more expressive gestural abstraction coming out of the [New York School](/gene/new-york-school) and the [School of Paris](/gene/post-world-war-ii-school-of-paris)."

Invented and pursued by [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso) and [Georges Braque](/artist/georges-braque) in Paris between 1907 and 1914 and inspired by the simplified landscapes of [Paul Cézanne](/artist/paul-cezanne), Cubism took the revolutionary step of rejecting the 500-year-old idea that a painting was like a window, thus ruled by perspective. Instead, Picasso and Braque created more conceptual, subjective paintings that sought to represent the underlying structure of existence. The best-known Cubist works look like shattered glass in dim browns and yellows, and are composed of various sharp planes that combine to form people or objects. Cubism took its name from an insult delivered by the critic Louis Vauxcelles, who commented that one of Braque’s paintings looked as if it were “full of little cubes.” After 1910, Picasso and Braque’s Cubism was quickly adopted by many other artists in Paris and beyond and ended up being the primary influence on most or all abstract art before the outbreak of World War II."

It is characterized by the rejection of old forms of artmaking in favor of an anti-art that asserts art’s irrelevance and explores new forms of creation. Dadaists are usually divided into two camps: those creating from anger and frustration and those embracing the absurd. Prominent adherents include [Francis Picabia](/artist/francis-picabia) and [Marcel Duchamp](/artist/marcel-duchamp), both of whom sought in their work to destabilize artistic dogmas, particularly traditional formal strategies and concepts of artistic meaning. From Zurich, Dada spread across Europe&mdash;most notably the German cities of Berlin, Cologne, and Hannover&mdash;and eventually into the United States, particularly New York City.

Although these artists never formed an official school—many were itinerant—their output during this period is marked by prominent stylistic traits. [Lucas Cranach](/artist/lucas-cranach-the-elder), who is credited as the father of the Danube School, produced work whose characteristic linearity, warm color palette, and lively depictions of nature would become hallmarks of painting in this region. Within European art history, the Danube School pioneered the landscape as an autonomous theme, as characterized by one of the school's most prominent practitioners [Albrecht Altdorfer](/artist/albrecht-altdorfer), and, in figurative paintings, focused on achieving glowing, ivory skin tones in supple-looking bodies. With their emphasis on the relationship of humans to nature and their recurring imagery of fairytale-like forests, the Danube School artists, along with [Albrecht Düre](/artist/albrecht-durer)r, who influenced their work, would come to serve as symbols of German identity for future generations of artists."

The major creative influence within the group was Mondrian, who in pursuit of a purer nonobjective abstraction (lacking a representational tie to any object or form) than that achieved in [Cubism](/gene/cubism), created reductive works composed of only straight lines, rectangles, and blocks of primary colors. The organizational principles and aesthetic look of Mondrian’s canvases are taken into three dimensions in De Stijl architecture, such as Gerrit Rietveld’s 1924 Schröder House, in Utrecht. The movement’s ideas had a pivotal role in the formation of Bauhaus practices and the emergence of the International Style."
509c23a53905453fec000937,deconstructivism,http://artsy.net/gene/deconstructivism,Deconstructivism,Style or Movement,"A term used to describe a tendency in architecture that began in the 1980s and rejected the basic premises of modern architecture. Architects who worked in this tradition spurned functionalist, anonymous aesthetics, instead focusing on complex geometries and surface treatments. Inspired in part by the theories of semiotic analysis known as “deconstruction” developed by French philosopher Jacques Derrida, they dissected standard modernist forms (such as the cube and right angles), often creating spaces with a preponderance of angles (regarding the angularity of her designs, [Zaha Hadid](/artist/zaha-hadid) has commented, “There are 360 degrees, so why stick to one?”). Deconstructivism is most closely associated with the architects Peter Eisenman, [Frank Gehry](/artist/frank-gehry), Hadid, Coop Himelblau, [Rem Koolhaas](/artist/rem-koolhaas), Daniel Liebeskind, and Bernard Tschumi, largely due to the Museum of Modern Art’s 1988 exhibition “Deconstructivist Architecture,” which first brought them together. Most of these architects, however, reject this association because it implies a homogenous style or set of concerns. While there is disagreement as to the nature of deconstructivism, the architect Philip Johnson (co-curater of the MoMA exhibition) has summarized it by saying, “It is the ability to disturb our thinking about form that makes these projects deconstructive.”  "

Expressionist art was often characterized by spontaneous brushwork or mark-making, distorted figures, a progression towards abstraction, and a concentration on forms and ideas borrowed from myths and so-called “primitive art.” In reaction to the shock of urbanization and the machine age, many of these artists attempted to convey psychological states of isolation and alienation, or sought refuge in the idea of a spiritual art. In Vienna, [Egon Schiele](/artist/egon-schiele) created unsettling, sinuous portraits that evoked the anxiety of the age; in Germany, the formal experiments of [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky) combined new forms and color combinations with a focus on mysticism and expression; and in the field of architecture, Bruno Taut translated the utopian ideals of the tendency into fantastic buildings."

After the First World War, the utopian and spiritual elements of this tendency gave way to the more political ideas of groups like the Dresden Secession and the Novembergruppe, many of whose members later became associated with [Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity)](/gene/neue-sachlichkeit).

Striving to capture the transient aspects of visual reality, especially light and color, Impressionists&mdash;the most familiar being [Claude Monet](/artist/claude-monet) and [Pierre Auguste Renoir](/artist/pierre-auguste-renoir)&mdash;emphasized firsthand observation of their subjects and focused on landscapes and everyday urban scenes. Like many subsequent avant-garde movements, it derived its name from a derisive label applied in a negative review. The 1874 Paris exhibition that introduced the group to the public contained Monet’s 1872 painting _Impression: Sunrise_, leading the critic Louis Leroy to coin the mocking term Impressionism, which the group co-opted. In the years following, Impressionism spread beyond France, most notably to Great Britain and the United States."

4df3cbc15786ea0001001f50,land-art,http://artsy.net/gene/land-art,Land Art,Style or Movement,"A shortening of the phrase ""landscape art,” used interchangeably with Earthworks to refer to pieces made of materials derived from the earth or situated on or within a landscape. Such works are usually site specific—created for and utilizing aspects or characteristics of a particular location. Both American and European artists began to use dirt, rocks, and sand as media and subject matter in the late 1960s, experimenting with diverse approaches. In 1967 the English artist Richard Long walked up and down a stretch of meadow over and over, creating a visible path depicted in the photograph _A Line Made by Walking_. This understated meditation on the symmetry and grace of a simple landscape contrasts with Land Art works that seek to dramatically alter a site, such as [Robert Smithson](/artist/robert-smithson)’s well-known 1970 sculpture and film, _Spiral Jetty_, which uses 7,000 tons of basalt, boulders, mud, and salt crystals mined from the area around Rozel Point, Great Salt Lake, Utah, to form a massive spiral winding 450 meters from the lake shore. Some of these works address ecological issues like those concerning activists in the 1960s. Alan Sonfist’s _Time Landscape_, for instance, which he proposed in 1965 and implemented in 1978, re-creates the original landscape on a small plot in Manhattan, calling attention to what is lost through urbanization and development.

While there is no overriding aesthetic of Neo-Conceptualism, painting and sculpture were generally avoided in favor of photography, video, and film, as well as forms of mass-media such as advertising.

Neo-Concrete Art was established in response to [Concrete Art](/gene/concrete-art), which emphasized the use of planes and colors to convey objective scientific principles. The Swiss artist Max Bill, a major exponent of Concrete Art, had significant exhibitions in São Paulo, Brazil in the early 1950s, inspiring a younger generation of artists there. In 1959, the _Neo-Concrete Manifesto_ was written by a group of artists in Rio de Janeiro—including [Lygia Clark](/artist/lygia-clark), [Hélio Oiticica](/artist/helio-oiticica), and Lygia Pape—who shared a similar interest in abstract forms and the use of color but wanted to insert poetic, and sometimes political, meaning and a greater sense of freedom and flexibility into their work. The merging of art and life was crucial: painting was to be removed from its frame, sculpture taken down from its pedestal, and the work constantly subject to re-invention by its viewers. This led to developments in participatory and immersive art, as exemplified by Oiticica's penetrable environments and wearable sculptures or Pape's envisioning of a world without words in _Book of Creation_. The critic Ronaldo Brito called Neo-Concrete Art a ""rupture"" in Brazilian art history, one that would inspire later generations of artists in Brazil, including those practicing under the repressive military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985."

Term coined by Dutch abstract painter [Piet Mondrian](/artist/piet-mondrian) and used as the title for a collection of writings he published in 1919. Neo-Plasticism, which can be best described as a philosophy, attempted a total overhaul and purification of all art that had come before in its exclusive application of horizontal and vertical lines and primary colors, black, and white. Rejecting the individualistic, emotional tenor of the then dominant [German and Austrian Expressionism](/gene/austrian-and-german-expressionism), the style harnessed the power of the ""mutual relation of forms,"" which could express a spiritual, even transcendental harmony. The universal and lasting purity achieved at the intersection of horizontal and vertical acted as a hopeful opportunity for wholeness and redemption after the nightmare of World War One. And aesthetically, the pared-down essentialism and flat, geometric sensibility of Neo-Plasticism would, like [Constructivism](/gene/constructivism), prove significant across several mediums and movements, like [Bauhaus](/gene/bauhaus), [Concrete Art](/gene/concrete-art), [Purism](/gene/purism), and later American abstraction."

Encouraged by [Henry Peach Robinson's](/artist/henry-peach-robinson) _Pictorial Effect in Photography_, first published in 1869, this artistic style was pursued throughout the U.S., Europe, and Latin America by photographers such as [Julia Margaret Cameron](/artist/julia-margaret-cameron), Robinson himself, and later groups such as [Alfred Stieglitz](/artist/alfred-stieglitz)'s Photo-Secession, founded in New York in 1902.

—Achille Bonito Oliva


Alongside [Arte Povera](/gene/arte-povera), the trans-avant-garde (Italian: transavanguardia) was one of Italy’s most important postwar artistic movements. Its name derives from Italian critic Achille Bonito Oliva’s 1981 essay entitled “The International Trans-Avant-Garde.” In this essay, Oliva named a small group of painters who, in the 1970s, departed from the dominant conceptual tendencies of the previous decade, exploring the expressive potential of painting with often universal or archaic motifs. This practice mirrored similar trends in expressive figurative painting across Europe and the United States, leading to the group’s frequent inclusion in discussions of 1980s [Neo-Expressionism](/gene/neo-expressionism). For Oliva, the trans-avant-garde rejected the original avant-garde’s “hysteria for the new” by returning to styles of the past. Indeed these artists quoted avidly not only from art history and classical mythology, but also popular culture and national symbolism.

The Floating World, as the pleasure districts of Edo (modern day Tokyo) were called, describes the sensory pleasures of urban life, but also offers a bittersweet reminder of the fleeting nature of all worldly delights. It’s commonly said that in Edo Japan, anyone could own a masterpiece Ukiyo-e print for about the price of a bowl of noodles. While this claim oversimplifies, it is true that by the 17th century, Ukiyo-e printmakers innovated centuries-old woodblock text printing techniques to create colorful picture prints that were distributed widely for popular consumption. Some of the greatest Japanese artists of their time—[Ando Hiroshige](/artist/utagawa-hiroshige-ando-hiroshige), [Katsushika Hokusai](/artist/katsushika-hokusai), [Utagawa Toyokuni III](/artist/utagawa-toyokuni-iii-utagawa-kunisada), and [Keisai Eisen](/artist/keisai-eisen) among them—became known primarily as woodblock print designers in the Ukiyo-e style. In the 19th century, Ukiyo-e printmakers also began to focus on landscape, creating series such as Hokusai’s famed _Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji_. Ukiyo-e also had a profound impact on European artists around this time—its flattened perspective and innovative compositions inspired artists such as [Mary Cassatt](/artist/mary-cassatt), [Vincent Van Gogh](/artist/vincent-van-gogh), and [Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec](/artist/henri-de-toulouse-lautrec), as well as the [Japonisme](/gene/japonisme) movement in art and design."

Indeed, the forward-looking Venetian school was also responsible for the shift toward the now-dominant use of oil paint on canvas and wood panel as opposed to fresco wall painting, perhaps owing to the overwhelming humidity near the sea. The school's influence proved great stylistically, too: its pleasure-seeking, even poetic sensibility, which stood in contrast to the cool, studied quality of Italian [Mannerism](/gene/mannerism) paved the way for the melodramatic vividness of 17th century [Baroque](/gene/baroque).

The prophet Muhummad's revelations, which were recorded as the contents of the Qu'ran, occurred in the early part of the 7th century. During the spread of Islam in subsequent centuries, a legible script printed on parchment was essential for transporting and sharing the Qu'ran. In the 9th century, paper became the preferred medium, which led to the development of a more fluid, cursive script in place of the more angular style of the past; paper permitted not only the spread of religious texts, but also the publishing of large numbers of secular books. Farsi calligraphy reached its height around 1400 AD and was regularly used for poetry. While Arabic continued to be the language of sacred texts, Farsi was considered the language of highest literary merit, even as far away as the Ottoman and Mughal empires (present-day Turkey and India, respectively). Images of God were forbidden by the Qu'ran, and figurative art was often suspected of idolatry, so calligraphy is amongst the highest art forms in the Muslim world. Contemporary uses of calligraphy can be found in [Ghada Amer](/artist/ghada-amer)'s sculptures, [Shirin Neshat](/artist/shirin-neshat-2)'s photography, and [Shahzia Sikhander](/artist/shahzia-sikander)'s drawings and paintings.

In the collage, a printed oilcloth simulated chair caning and a piece of rope functioned as both a frame and the border of a café table.

[Claes Oldenburg](/artist/claes-oldenburg), [Robert Morris](/artist/robert-morris), [Yayoi Kusama](/artist/yayoi-kusama), and [Joseph Beuys](/artist/joseph-beuys), among others, used felt and other consumer-grade fabrics to create “[soft sculptures](/gene/soft-sculpture)”; Christo and Jean-Claude draped entire buildings and natural geological formations in millions of square feet of bright or shimmery textiles to draw attention to their impermanence. In his recreation of historic European costumes, [Yinka Shonibare](/artist/yinka-shonibare) uses the colorful patterns of Dutch wax fabric—popularly associated with Africa, but actually produced in Holland—to highlight the role textiles have played in the history of colonialism and global trade."

This tendency has its roots in the work of American collagist [Joseph Cornell](/artist/joseph-cornell), who in the 1930s frequented used bookstores and antique shops in search of arcane printed matter and historical curios for his works. Emerging from a tendency toward [assemblage](/gene/assemblage) in 1950s San Francisco, [Bruce Conner](/artist/bruce-conner), long an enthusiast of popular art from the late 19th century, created a series of collages that brought together vintage printed sources. From the “twee,” old-timely world of filmmaker Wes Anderson to the popularity of cursive fonts and handle-bar mustaches, this antiquarian sensibility continues to resonate in contemporary culture at large.

For many artists, even the purest abstraction is derived from nature—indeed, to invent the first non-objective painting in 1913, [Wassily Kandinsky](/artist/wassily-kandinsky) channeled his love of nature as an experience of color. Countless artists since, [Abstract Expressionist](/gene/abstract-expressionism) Frankenthaler included, have captured the [landscape](/gene/landscape) not in a literal likeness, but rather in its forms, colors, effects, or the subjective experience it gives rise to."

The borrowed images can be minimally altered, as in the photographs of [Sherrie Levine](/artist/sherrie-levine), or combined into elaborate compositions, as in the work of [David Salle](/artist/david-salle). Appropriation has a venerable history. Both [Edouard Manet](/artist/edouard-manet) and [Pablo Picasso](/artist/pablo-picasso), for example, took historical artworks as departure points for their own pieces, and Picasso was one of the first to use items from the mass media in his work. [Marcel Duchamp](/artist/marcel-duchamp) appropriated a urinal, turning it upside down, signing, and titling it. However, it could be argued that as a group, appropriation artists of the 1980s employed the practice more than their predecessors."

Beginning largely with the [Dada](/gene/dada) movement in the late 1910s, Western artists have incorporated elements of chance in the creation and presentation of their work. This development is thought to have been inspired by a loss of faith in ordered Western civilization in the wake of World War I, as well by the development of relativist principles in fields ranging from quantum physics to psychology to Eastern philosophy. [Jean Arp](/artist/jean-arp) composed collages by dropping shapes at random while [Marcel Duchamp](/artist/marcel-duchamp) recorded the patterns formed by dropped strings; both diminished the status of the artist's conscious decisions in creating an artwork. Explorations of chance and the potential of the unconscious were central to both [Surrealism](/gene/surrealism) as well artists of later generations, like the [Abstract Expressionists](/gene/abstract-expressionism). [Ellsworth Kelly](/artist/ellsworth-kelly), for one, is well-known for choosing the colors for his grid paintings by rolling dice. The 1960s [Happenings](/gene/happenings) associated with [Fluxus](/gene/fluxus) and others introduced a new element of chance into art-making, with [John Cage](/artist/john-cage) famously using flipped coins as a means of composing musical scores."

While the aesthetics of digital technology evolve as rapidly as technology itself, common characteristics include pixilation, color gradients, or manually rendered memes. James Bridle has coined the term “The New Aesthetic,” referring to what he calls an “eruption of the digital into the physical.” Works like _Flaming Bluetooth Sculpture_ by the collaborative duo AIDS-3D, or Patrick Lichty’s textile renditions of computer game graphics and “LOL” cat memes, take aspects of digital aesthetics and reproduce them in more traditional media.

Perhaps most closely associated with this practice is [Marina Abramović](/artist/marina-abramovic-1), who, since the 1970s, has created provocative, long-durational performances that have pushed the artist to her physical breaking point, often to the point of imperilment.

A general category for artworks that repeat images, elements, or gestures. While repetition has long played a role in art-making—take, for instance, the repetitive nature of the Terracotta Army from China in the 3rd century B.C.—it only truly became central to (and a pronounced element of) the practices of numerous artists in the 20th century, in many respects because of the increased ease of reproducing art and the advent of an infinitely reproducible medium—photography. Walter Benjamin wrote of photographs, ""from a negative… one can make any number of prints; to ask for the 'authentic' print makes no sense."" Such a blurring of the boundary between ""original"" and ""copy"" through repetition paved the way for the factory-like appropriation and creation of images from mass media found in the [Pop Art](/gene/pop-art) of Andy Warhol, who in addition to silkscreening images of Campbell's soup cans over and over again was said to have eaten the brand of soup for lunch every day for twenty years. Repetition was also a major theme of [Minimalism](/gene/minimalism) and [Conceptual Art](/gene/conceptual-art), as well as [Performance Art](/gene/performance-art), as in the repeated acts (for humor as well as self-abuse) performed by [Bruce Nauman](/artist/bruce-nauman), [Chris Burden](/artist/chris-burden), and [Marina Abramovic](/artist/marina-abramovic)."

While there are many historic precedents for this type of presenting research in art—such as [Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier](/artist/jean-louis-ernest-meissonier)’s rigorous study of the movement of horses—(in some respects, all great art is the product of extensive research), since the 1990s, art has often approximated academic or journalistic inquiry in its attempts to contribute to knowledge, engage the public, and bring awareness to causes or subjects. The photographs of [Taryn Simon](/artist/taryn-simon), for example, are typically the culmination of years of research; in _A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters_ (2011), the artist traveled around the world, tracing, and then documenting, bloodlines. This notion of research as art differs from traditional scholarship in that it is not characteristically beholden to disciplinary conventions and parameters, and may present “findings” in visually aesthetic formats or those otherwise atypical of academic or journalistic publications.

This concept arose as a result of 1960s artists’ increasing interest in the physical contexts of their artmaking, specifically how different contexts could change (and more importantly, complicate) the experience of an artwork. The best-known example of this type of work is [Richard Serra](/artist/richard-serra)’s _Tilted Arc_, which Serra created specifically for a public plaza in Lower Manhattan in 1979 and that was commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts. Public outcry against the work was intense, and as a result, the work was removed in 1989.

Sander's series presented a selection of types of people—such as farmers, factory workers, socialists, and actors—in the desire to create a complete cross-section of German society. The Becher's ""typologies"" are most often grids of black-and-white photographs in which each picture in the grid is a different example of a type of industrial building or structure, such as water towers, blast furnaces, or gas tanks."
