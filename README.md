#The Art Genome Project's Genes (categories) and definitions

An exported list of The Art Genome Project's categories (genes), including names, types, and definitions. List uploaded in CSV format with UTF-8 encoding, and will be updated as needed on a monthly basis.

Please note that while we strive to define each and every gene fully, some do not have definitions, while others have basic ones.

##How to use this list

In The Art Genome Project, every gene (category) is applied along with a value from 1-100 that indicates its relevance to the paritcular work, artist, designer or architect. 

However, this list may still be used as subject headings, tags, or general categories for organizing collections of artworks and artists.

We welcome any and all feedback. **Please reach out to us at genome@artsy.net if you are using this list in your own research, we'd love to hear your perspective, learn from  your experience and keep you posted on future updates.**

##Who can use this list?

While anyone may reference this list of categories and definitions for research or personal use, we've created this public repository particularly with the GLAM community (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) in mind.

We ask that you give credit to Artsy if using this list, and that you reach out to our team at **[genome@artsy.net](mailto:genome@artsymail.com)**to let us know about your project and how you'll be using it. You might consider this list a "pilot program" for possible future releases, and so your feedback is extremely important to us.
